Website for Dark Acre Church indexing Twitch broadcast archives.
Overview: A website for indexing and archiving activity from the Twitch channel. Must be clean, readable, accessible, *simple*. Must be mobile-friendly.

Main page: Title, relevant socials links (Twitch page, Twitter, Backloggery, Steam), most recent archives, search bar.

Episode page: Episode number and title with date of live broadcast and link to YouTube archive.

Section for each game seen (space for 6-12). Should include: Game Title, link to purchase page with PC/Steam prioritised, Steam metadata if available - price, rating, screenshots? OpenCritic and MetaCritic (primary and user) scores, Jack decision (Owned, Wishlist, Followed, Ignored, allow multiple of these to be chosen). Link to YouTube archive (if available) starting at timestamp of actual appearance during broadcast, video opens in a pop-up?

Allow comments via Disqus.

If possible, allow data updating to be performed from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Current archive sheet contains fields for Episode #, Title, Date of Broadcast, Content title, Jack decision, and YouTube time-stamp.
